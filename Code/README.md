## Arima_without_footfall.ipynb
- This is the benchmark strategy which just uses the stock price data 

## Price_based_strategy.ipynb
- In this file we solve the casino stock price prediction problem by implementing each of the below models. Our inputs include technical indicators and footfall. of  1) Linear regression mdoel 
2) Lasso regression model 
3) Neural Networks model
4) Decision Tree model 
5) Random Forest model 

## Price_based_strategy_Without_Footfall.ipynb
- This file has the same implementations as above but here we just use the technical indicators as inputs. We dont consider the footfall numbers. 

## LSTM_Keras.ipynb
- In this file we have the LSTM implementation of predicting stock price using technical indicators and footfall. The results are subpar compared to Neural Networks model or Lasso model
